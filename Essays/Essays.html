             It’s crazy how unconscious the experience of traversing a website or app is when it is done exceptionally well. 
             A good UI is never noticed because it aids better interaction and traversal of a product and thus users focus their energy on the main purpose of interacting with a website. 
             Only when it is bad, distracting, and confusing will users pick up on it and thus implying that a better approach needs to be used.<strong style="color: white;"><em>This essay sets out to conduct a critical 
             heuristic and interaction design analysis of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) of South Africa’s website, examining its adherence to usability principles and interaction design norms</em></strong>. 
             Drawing on the works of Miklos Philips and Moulthrop, the analysis will also evaluate the effectiveness of the website’s UI/UX design, focusing particularly on its usability, pros and cons, 
             adherence to interaction design principles and alignment with ethical considerations.

             A heuristic analysis is an evaluation of a products usability that uses a set of predefined design principles to examine the interface and test its compliance to the recognized heuristics <cite style="color: white;">(Philips, 2016)</cite>. 
             The design principles amongst many include usability quality components such as learnability, discoverability, memorability, flexibility, and interaction design constraints.  The lack of adherence to the 
             latter aspects of usability can in turn affect the user experience of a particular website and this can be seen from a variety of websites. Looking into the IEC website, users can immediately notice the influx 
             of information that they are presented with on their screen. The large availability of information presented to users as they engage with this website speaks to the lack of interaction design constraints that are 
             supposed to direct the “flow” that users are supposed to follow as they navigate the website, similar to how other hypertext systems are constructed without being constrained to linear arrangements of discourse <cite style="color: white;">(Moulthrop, 1991)</cite>.
             According to Miklos Philips, “the opposite of interaction design constraints is when every option is available to the user and thus making it difficult for them to decide what to do next” <cite style="color: white;">(Philips, 2016)</cite>. 
             The latter statement is exactly what users see in the IEC website in how users are not only  provided with information on how to undergo the process of registering to vote, but they  are also provided with extra information via an 
             infographic that lets them know about the election timetable. At the same time, an actual separate section that addresses the same information is also available as a hyperlink to direct users to another webpage. This increases the 
             possibility of users becoming overwhelmed with most options available to them and thus violating the heuristic usability principle of user control leading to users traversing the website in a way that the designers of it did not intend.

             <em>Feedback</em> within a website plays a significant role in letting users know of the results of their actions and the current state of the system or website they are engaging with <cite style="color: white;">(Philips, 2016)</cite>. 
             In the IEC website, when users hover their mouse cursor over certain texts, the colour changes from being black or white to being blue. Not only does the text colour change but the symbol of the cursor itself also changes from an arrow 
             to an actual small hand with an index finger up, signifying to users that the text they are hovering over is clickable. Not only does this speak to the well use of adhering to the usability design principle of signifiers, letting users 
             know which actions are possible and which are not but on bigger realm it also informs the well-thought-out intuitive approach that is also reflected within the colour theory and design used <cite style="color: white;">(Philips, 2016)</cite>.
             The use of clear signifiers enhances the overall user experience as it reduces the ambiguity and helps the users navigate the website more efficiently, understanding what sets something clickable from what is not. 
             This, in turn contributes to the websites’ usability and user satisfaction in how users get a response for the actions that they have done. Be it the result of the changing in colour or being redirected to another webpage, users are given 
             immediate result of their actions, accelerating the speed at which they can find what they are looking for as far as voting elections are concerned because of the direct consequence of better usability. 
             Moreover, the design choice of using colour theory in a way that aligns with the principles of user-centred design and cognitive psychology further improves the usability and overall user experience of traversing this website amidst all the information overload. 
             Users can apply conventions of cognitive colour theory, aided by the realistic approach of using a changing cursor that detects hypertext to access information related to what the user may be looking for <cite style="color: white;">(Moulthrop, 1991)</cite>.

            <em>There is a strong link between the mental models created by users and how the conceptual model of the designers drives the creation of the user’s mental model when traversing a web site</em>. While conceptual models refer to the design models that the designer used 
             or had in relation to the experience intended for the user, mental models are the mental images the user creates in their mind that inform their expectations of a certain interaction and how something works in  real life <cite style="color: white;">(Philips, 2016)</cite>. Within traversing the 
             IEC Website, the repetition of information underscored by the websites visual hierarchy creates an inconsistent redundancy that in turn leads to an unexpected mental model created is the users’ minds.  
             Instances where users encounter redundancy and thus an inconsistency in the visual hierarchy include when users scroll down the IEC website, they notice a repetition of the election timetable, provided through an infographic and a separate hypertext. 
             Users also notice a repetition of information regarding the “elections”, that was already provided in depth at the top half of the website.
             The consequence of this redundancy of extra information provided to the users creates a different mental model, one that deviates from the conceptual model the designer intended for the user to feel or experience. 
             Furthermore, the implications of this redundancy in deviating from the conceptual model intended for the user include an unplanned lack of interest in scrolling down the rest of the website.  
             As a result, users may end their scrolling without getting to the end if the information post the already provided one is not useful . The latter implication also extends to how the observed repetition of information on the IEC website influences user’s perceptions 
             and understanding of the content as they contemplate what point the repetition aimed to make if the repeated information does not add nuance to the former information they encountered.

             To improve the website’s design to align user’s mental models more closely with the designer conceptual models, designers should’ve omitted the extra information that relates top similar ideas already touched on in the top half of the website.  
             Furthermore, the removal of the infographic and replacing it with only one hyperlink (the one in the navigation panel) would’ve reduced the chunk of information overload. Upcoming events, latest media releases and did you know (fun facts) could’ve 
             have been made hyperlinks within the navigation panel so that users are directed to a specific webpage that addresses each aspect individually, apart from what is the main content of the website found in the homepage. That way, information is dispersed into 
             sections (webpages) and each aspect of the website has its own section that it focuses on. Not only does this decrease the quantity of information overload but it ensures that the “flow” of the website is not disrupted by extra information that is not important 
             to the user at a particular moment. This ultimately decreases the users cognitive load and thus would foster a better user experience derived from the website overall. From an ethical consideration’s perspective, it also ensures that the user’s intuitive approach 
             is drawn upon, further enhancing the relationship between users and the services (the website) they engage with.

             Looking deeper into accessibility of the IEC website, the lack of accessibility in the absence of the “alt” attribute within their image tag as far as its semantic mark-up is concerned is problematic. Not only is the infographic image embedded without using the appropriate 
             semantic tag, but it also compromises the accessibility of people with disabilities. Blind people who use Braille or screen readers to read would not be able to understand what the actual infographic image contains. This is also problematic as it infers an ableist approach 
             to the mark-up of the website, considering only those who can visually see and marginalizing the demographic of people with disabilities. To improve this, the use of the “alt” tag within the image tag would’ve aided a great deal for Blind people who use screen readers to still 
             understand what the infographic image is about.

             <em>Visual Hierarchy within a website plays a huge role in facilitating to users what’s more important than the other</em>. 
             According to Miklos Philips,<blockquote style="color: white;">“Visual Hierarchy concerns the arrangement of elements in a way that implies importance. It influences the order at which the human eye perceives”</blockquote><cite>(Philips, 2016)</cite>. 
             In the IEC website, using scale and proximity aided users to see what information is of main importance and which one is an extension of the information already provided. The first top half of the website is divided into all clickable information, and this is seen through the proximity of the right pointed 
             arrows next to the hyperlink texts. Information about checking the status of ones voting registration, the election timetable, voting at another district or station are also overlaid with a blue backdrop to reference the colour scheme of the voting organization and further emphasize the main political information 
             that underpins the purpose of this website. By doing so, users are prompted to focus seamlessly on transitioning from each aspect of voting to the next without the effort of having to scroll down to find a piece of information that relates to what their previous action was about.

             <em>In the IEC websites’ quest to emphasizing the main political aspects of the website through its visual hierarchy, not only does this enhance the adherence of the website to the heuristic usability principle of discoverability, but it also underscores the seamless blend of the heuristic principle of discoverability with 
             the concept of Fitts’s Law</em>. This law echoes the sentiments emphasized by the heuristic principle of visual hierarchy and discoverability in that a thoughtful use of interaction design from the lens of  a user is enhanced if the designers consider the traversal of a website from the perspective of the user (Philips, 2016). 
             The emphasis of this law in relation to the IEC website is seen through the short mouse movements or clicks that users are prompted to use because of how close the targets are in relation to other targets. According to Miklos Philips, “it is always faster to click or swipe a target if it is closer to your starting position. 
             Related tasks should also be near each other, so users don’t dart around the screen” (Philips, 2016). The latter statement further underscores the thoughtful interaction design reflected in fostering a seamless traversal of the website.

             Therefore, it is thus quite evident how paramount the adherence to heuristic design principles and interaction design principles is towards great contribution to the website overall user experience. 
             Not only does it foster a strong link between the designer conceptual model and users’ mental model, but it also ensures that a better user experience usability of the websites. 
             A better seamless user experience in turn makes one ponder about the meaningful relationship that is created between users and the website content they engage with.
