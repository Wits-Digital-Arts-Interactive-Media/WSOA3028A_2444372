       <p class="p-summary">This blog post is a reflection on the first week of work done in this course and what i've learned</p>
        <p id="ref">
        My experience with setting up GitHub was a seamless one in that it was quite easy to understand how to set up stuff like 
        repositories and commits because of having used them last year. Deploying the website onto the pages section of git was
        quite interesting and very fun to learn. I had questions about it which got answered during our class session and I was very
        content with what i learnt from class. i was excited with making the website even though it wasn't my first time setting up 
        my html doccie as i have some experience with working with html from my previous undergrad. Overall , it was an insightful
        and interesting event working with git and setting up the flow for the entire semester !

    <h1 class="heading">Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today:</h1>
    <section id="ref">
        So I did two of the readings we were provided with. Namely;<strong style="color: white"><em> Berners-Lee et al "The World wide Web" as well as Bush V's "As We May Think".</em></strong>
        With the first one; i found it quite easy to understand especially as far the subject mattter is concerned. It provided a lot of
        context to the understanding of what really makes up the web at large. I learnt a lot about the concepts W3C and W3 Client Programme
        ,the utilization of the HTTP Protocol , the fundamentals of the URLs and URI schemes as well as HTML as a mark up language
        and all that underpins it <cite style="color: white;">(Berners-Lee et al, 1994)</cite>.
        <br>
        <br>
        In terms of relating the reading at large with my experience with the internet today; the reading really provided a lot of 
        exposition to the use of internet as we know it today. It helped me understand not only the meanings of sources i interact
        with on a daily but it also helped situate my headspace into the foundations that formed the internet we have today that i may have been oblivious to for some time.
        Looking deeper into the implications of the reading in terms of how we can relate it to the internet and the world of the web in contemporary times, 
        this reading helped unpack a lot of  colloborative effort that went into creating the web as we have it today. It's crazy how the people that created the web"
        basically created a system that continues to serve the world even post their mortality. In the lectures, Lucky Nkosi mentions something so interesting
        about the web which I found worth noting around how it relates to the implications of the reading on the internet today in that, he mentions that 
        with great power , comes great responsiblity and he means this in relation to how web developers understood what fundamentals of the web
        had to go into ensuring that they create a web that is not easy to break. This makes one ponder about the state of the internet today and how many cyber and systems
        attacks are being done backhandedly to destroy the web. This is why , he goes on to mention , its important that we get taught how to create websites in a correct way 
        so we don't contribute to the fatality of the legacy that was left by people like Bush.

    <section id="ref">
        I found Bush's text very complex at first. I think this was because it was because of the vocabulary and phrasing of most terms
        that he uses to explain a lot of things. After a few re-reads i understood the reading at  large as underpinned by the background
        knowledge of a modern day computer. in the reading , he takes us on a journey of he develped his concept of a modern day computer
        using what he terms as a "MEMEX" <cite style="color: white;">(Bush, 1945)</cite>. He defines it as a digital library device that essentially stores all his books, records and
        communications. The reading also fiils us in on the evolution of machines post the times the reading was written in 1945 and 
        and what the changes that have been made mean for those who engage with the medium of computers today.
        <br>
        <br>
        This made the reading more interesting for me in relation to my experience today because i particularly found the way he explains the evolution and 
        contemporary existence of photography intersting in relation to which the internet started as versus what it is has become.
        From someone who was part of the Manhattan , living in times where they had no internet and how he became the brains behind
        the creation of a modern computer speaks volume about the different ways in which internet was understood back in the day 
        to how it is perceived today. There is a lot of history that underpins the existence of the internet and all the technologies
        that we use to access it that have become close to being erased in contemporary times because we couldn't "care" less about 
        it was brought about. What the reading does is to remind about that history and shift the paradigm on the internet "as we may think"
        about it.

    <h1 class="heading">Interesting things you have found about the history of the web:</h1>
    <section id="ref">
        Based off reading the history of the WWW, I have found quite a few things interesting about the web that i think should be 
        embraced more. This includes the huge contribution of people like Tim Berners-Lee in coming up with the idea of the web back in 
        1989. It is interesting how the creation of the internet as well as the web started of as something at a small scale that utilizes 
        mark up languages like html has made it to become so extensible to the users back then as well users of today who still engage
        with the raw idea that was produced from years ago. The stages of history that the web has undergone encompassing the creation 
        of more technologies such as the URLs is also one of things i found particularly interesting about the web because of how it teaches us 
        of the broader scope that underpins the web apart from its connection to networks of networks and its existence on the internet.

    <h1 class="heading">Your goals for this course:</h1>
    <section id="ref">
        Apart from wanting to improve my knowledge in the space of web dev and passing really well, i also look forward to using the skills gained here as well 
        the portfolio we are going to make and investing it into the creation of more authentic inventions. I hope to hone and channel
        my skill and knowledge into creating intuitive websites and apps, ones that will help alleviate some of the issues we experience
        today.
