            <p class="p-summary">This blog post extends on the user alignment by delving into the type of content to be found on this site as well as the ui/ux</p>
            <section>
                User alignment as a concept largely encompasses the way the layout, the content, and features of a website meet and are in line with the needs 
                and expectations of the users that will interact and engage with your website.
                With that said, more than anything, I want my website to showcase and offer a lot more than I can do academically.
                I want users <strong>to see beyond my academic capabilities</strong> and <strong> to experience my thoughts especially my commentary on 
                socio-cultural, political, and current affairs</strong> that affect myself as well as the users that would potentially be interacting with the website.
                Exploration of my academic skillsets remains the key however its not the only purpose the existence of my website will serve.
