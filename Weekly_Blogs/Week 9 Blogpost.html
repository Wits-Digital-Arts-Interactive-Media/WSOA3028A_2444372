            <hr>
           <p><em><strong>Towards a study of information geographies:(im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information by 
            Mark Graham1 , Stefano De Sabbata1 and Matthew A. Zook</strong></em></p>
            <p2>
                This reading was very insightful. It gave me a lot of thoighst and ideas around the existence of information and the understanding of what 
                information geographies are. It helped me underdtand the significance of not assuming that the education we receive at schools doesn'r really stem 
                from the books we read but in and of itself it has an origina that has  informed the knowldege acquired from the books.
            </p2>
            <h4>Reading Synopsis:</h4>
            <p5>
                This reading begins by introducing readers to the fundamental understanding of the origin of information. It makes readers understand the 
                core point of how information has a geography and within that geography, lies a host of uneven acceses to information, partcipation and 
                representation. It delves deeper into the understanding of how information suring the pre-digital era, information was used as a form of gaining 
                <strong>epistemic control </strong> as people usually associated value to epistemic governance and the power that came with holding a certain quantity
                of information. It also greatly reinforces the survey that was conducted that was focused on three main aspects as far as information geographies
                having their own geographic distributions are concerned. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Geographies of access = which refers to <strong >WHO</strong> has access to which information and at what pooint are they aware of that</li>
                    <li>Geographies of participation = which refers to<strong>WHERE</strong></li>the digital information is generated from which informs those who are
                    included and exclded by virtue of infiormation beings digitized.
                    <li>Geographies of representation = which refers to <strong>WHICH</strong>part of the world the information dissipated is available for and which 
                    people can use it because it is create for them or not created for them.</li>
                </ul>
             </p5>
            <h5>Reading Subject Matter and personal thoughts:</h5>
            <p6>
                With a particualar focus on the strong inherent link between  geographic information  and the host of uneven geographies, this reading put a lot into 
                perspective with regards to the varying degrees that information can be accssed and retrieved by users. It really helped me understand the dynamics related to information 
                geographies that cause an uneven geographies of accesss especially towards contemporay modes of communication  where even the other geographic distributions
                end up being amplified as opposed to being alleviated. the reading also helped me understand where the epistemic  control or power over information comes from 
                and the long lasting impact it has had on the influencing the host of uneven grographies of pariciapaiton and representataion we have today. This was particulalry 
                insightful when relating the latter statements to the web today as there is a clear distinction between those that have access to the information on the internet
                and those that don‚Äôt. This has also led to the coining of the term digital divide. In parctice , this has also exacerbated the constraint that have been placed 
                into hegemonic representation and hegemonic modes of participation as  as the knowledge rooted within the information produced is strongly linked with conditions of 
                power and control. Unfortunately, within the current web 2.0 the world is currently at or heading toawards, this has meant a radical change in the way that information
                is produced and used, implying that we are now in an age of post-information scarcity.
