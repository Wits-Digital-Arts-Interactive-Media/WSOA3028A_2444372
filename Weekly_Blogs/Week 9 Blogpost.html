            <p class="p-summary">This blog post is reflection writing based on insights and understanding gained from the reading below:</p>
            <hr>
           <p><em><strong>Towards a study of information geographies:(im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information by 
            Mark Graham1 , Stefano De Sabbata1 and Matthew A. Zook</strong></em></p>
            <p2>
                This reading was very insightful. It gave me a lot of thoighst and ideas around the existence of information and the understanding of what 
                information geographies are. It helped me underdtand the significance of not assuming that the education we receive at schools doesn'r really stem 
                from the books we read but in and of itself it has an origina that has  informed the knowldege acquired from the books.

            <h4>Reading Synopsis:</h4>
            <p5>
                This reading begins by introducing readers to the fundamental understanding of the origin of information. It makes readers understand the 
                core point of how information has a geography and within that geography, lies a host of uneven acceses to information, partcipation and 
                representation. It delves deeper into the understanding of how information suring the pre-digital era, information was used as a form of gaining 
                <strong>epistemic control </strong> as people usually associated value to epistemic governance and the power that came with holding a certain quantity
                of information. It also greatly reinforces the survey that was conducted that was focused on three main aspects as far as information geographies
                having their own geographic distributions are concerned. These include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Geographies of access = which refers to <strong >WHO</strong> has access to which information and at what pooint are they aware of that</li>
                    <li>Geographies of participation = which refers to<strong>WHERE</strong></li>the digital information is generated from which informs those who are
                    included and exclded by virtue of infiormation beings digitized.
                    <li>Geographies of representation = which refers to <strong>WHICH</strong>part of the world the information dissipated is available for and which 
                    people can use it because it is create for them or not created for them.</li>
                </ul>
             </p5>
