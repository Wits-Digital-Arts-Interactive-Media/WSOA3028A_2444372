            Subject Matter:
            <br>
            The reading speaks about the importance of recognizing digital inequalities amongst other  traditional forms of inequalities 
            in the 21st-Century. It argues that Digital inequality is one of the new forms of emerging inequalities alongside
            race, sex  and gender and also has the potential to to shape life in multiple ways especially within a nagative light.
            The latter is especially true when considering the  extent to which there is a large gap between those who function better in the 
            digital realm because they've had a higher internet access usage than those who arent't as privilleged and thus  have become digitally
            disadvantaged. The reading further delves into the various ways that digital inequalities manifest themselves in areas of life,
            further reinforcing the significant role for the awareness and recognition of them as an important  form of inequality to be weary of.
            These various ways of  varying digital engagements that warrant a close reading on social research  include: 
            <ul>
                <li>The life course</li>
                <li>Gender</li>
                <li>Race and Ethnicity</li>
                <li>Economic Inequalities, entrepreneurship and consumption.</li>
            </ul>
            During the life course, digital inequalities manifest themselves in various ways which include the usage of digital resroucrs from 
            youn children all the way across to adulthood. With a close eye amongst children, the rate at which their digital footprint is 
            increasing is an intersting insight generated by social science research, especially considering how many chcldren in their adolescent 
            are hooked onto their phones 24/7. As a result, this has different consequences on their digital engagements as it becomes 
            very clear which of the children  have access to use dital resources and those who don't. As such, students who have unrestricted  online 
            access spend majorty of their time doing everthing but acadeic work and thus the excess exposure goes up to 3 hours min.
            For those that do not have that much access to digital resources, when they are compelled  by academic expectations,they are forced to ration
            their screen time and thus get deprived to actually get the web skills they need to also exist as efficiently as possible within their 
            life course.These long-term differences in daily internet engagaments further exacrbate the digital divide and inequalities that exists within 
            the daily lives of those affected by the uneven distribution of digital resources.

            Within digital technologies exists a huge gap between men and women and the ways in which digital resources  such as the internet, mobile
            devices and computers. According to the reading , recent studies have been more focused on trying to understand the mechanisms that undeprin
            the underlying differences. Although Research shows that the gap between men and women with regards to internet access has siginifcantly reduced
            implying that both genders have ultimate access, it still does not mean that the playing field is level. Especially if one 
            considers the "catfishing" as well as "imposter acting" activities that people do online.
            By virtue of the latter statement, it becomes logical to conclude that there is an intersectional relationship that exists between digital
            inequalities and gender especially with regards to gender disperities within gendering of  the skills and content production  as well as through
            gendered labour market processes and the job selection criterions for jobs within  the technological spaces.

            As far as the manifestation of various forms of digital inequalities within race and ethncity, according to the reading ;
            the study of different social groups, particularly ethnic and racial minorities becomes paramount for the purposes of undderstanding
            the potential threats and the impact of their technological access and influence if one social group has significantly better and advantaged digital 
            engagement. According to the reading, I've learnt to find that most of the stratification thay holds the processes  of ICTs is deeply rooted within
            amplifying existing social inequalities even in the creauon of new technologies. As such, this further exacerbates the the gap between certain ethnic and 
            racial minorities that have access and an upper hand at the digital engagement than those those have less and close to no upper hand at digital engagement 
            with these modes of technology. As such, this has caused the Internet usage amongst ethnic and racial minorities to be typically lower 
            than the internet and technogies usage for racial majority groups. Thus internet exlusion  becomes another form of marginalization,
            further reinforcing the underlying digital inequalities that yet continue to exist are perpetuated within existing social inequalities.
