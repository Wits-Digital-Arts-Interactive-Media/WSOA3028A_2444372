            <p class="p-summary"> This reflection section is a piece of writing that delves into the overall status  of the site and design decisions made thus far:
                <section>
                    <p1>
                     From  a design perspective and the incorporation of the JavaScript code within my website, I have noticed a large disconnect  between the layout of my wireframes design(tabular format navigation menu),  specifically
                     with the way navigation menu is currently dynamically laid out in an unordered list format. In my wireframes design and style guide, I created my wireframes with the incoporation of CSS tabular
                     data layout as opposed to the unordered list format that I currently have within my site. Part of the reason why there is a disconnect between what the wireframes 
                     are showing and the actual navigation menu layout is because my javascript code has been made to adapt to the use of an unordered list as opposed to the use of tables because in my head 
                     I was going to use CSS to properly structure my navigation menu layout using the appropriate styling code for that. I did try to adapt my menu js code to using tabular data without the css 
                     and in as much as I did not struggle in changing the code for my desired objective, at the end of the day , this assignment required more intergration  of the Javascript code than it required for
                     the  CSS code. As such, I didn't want to create an un-true expectation of CSS code within my site when we haven't got to incorporating CSS within our site yet, well 
                     atleast for the Website 2 assignment. I plan on fixing this disconnect between the layout designs and navigation menu layouts through the usage  of my CSS code , in  the 
                     next assignment. This should create a consistent and connected design decisons between what the wireframes designs are showing and the actual structure of my site overall.
