           "One of the ways I feel that the Constitution failed us, is by giving almost absolute protection to Western property 
            rights in section 25 which has made it difficult for land equity in S.A post 1994. It basically made it okay for 
            Apartheid benefactors to keep everything they had and gave them protection. It basically legitimized colonial land theft. 
            It's considered a compromise in that it allowed for redistribution and also recognizes customary property rights but those 
            usually only apply in Bantustans typically" <span class="grey"><cite>(Gebane, 2024)</cite></span>.

            <strong><u>Background Info(Recap from the previous commentary):</u><br><br></strong>
            In the recent national election, the ANC lost its majority for the first time since the end of apartheid, winning only 40% of the vote. 
            The DA, the main opposition party, secured 22% of the vote. To form a government, the ANC needed to find coalition partners because as 
            already expressed in the previous commentary, it did not manage to gain enough seats to maintain its standalone governance in parliament.
            The following  is an explanation of the coalition  in depth:<br><br>
            In simple terms, a coalition is an alliance formed between two parties or organizations to achieve a common goal or to form a government.
            This often occurs in parliamentary systems where no single party has gained an outright majority of seats in the legislature (already explained
            above).<br><br>
            After intense negotiations, the ANC and DA agreed to form a coalition government, with the ANC as the senior partner. 
            The DA will support Cyril Ramaphosa's re-election as president, and an ANC leader will become the Speaker of Parliament, 
            while a DA leader(John Steenhuisen) will become the Deputy Speaker.<br><br>
            As expected , not a lot of people were happy with this alliance between the aforementioned parties. Here's what some people had to say:<br><br>

            Maybe Bhekithemba Mngomezulu has a point. The DA has been believed to be uphold white supremacy and this has been seen within their leadership within the
            Western Cape. Some of the challenges that this coaltion may bring include the fact that the ANC and DA have differing ideologies, 
            which may lead to tensions and conflicts within the coalition. Moreover, because the two parties have different policies and run their parioes differently, 
            Finding common ground on key policies may be challenging, potentially leading to watered-down decisions.
            Moreover, Some may view the coalition as a betrayal by the ANC or a sell-out by the DA, potentially leading to public disillusionment.
            It is getting to a point where people are conflicted on which party to choose or support because they each party has its own discrepancies that affect each person
            one way or other.

            Implications for the People of South Africa:<br><br>
            The coalition obviously has and will impact the people of South Africa, not only from a stability standpoint within their goverment but also from other aspects such as 
            economic growth and overall service delivery. The following are some of the implications explained: <br><br>
            - Stability: The coalition government may bring greater stability, as the ANC and DA work together to address the country's challenges. While the latter provides a branch of hope
            to the people of South Africa, we have no choice but  wait and observe the changes this coalition might bring. It makes me wonder if we are ever going to get to a point 
            where we fully trust our government again...<br><br>
            - Economic growth: The DA's business-friendly approach may influence economic policy, potentially leading to increased investment and growth. Considering the latter point and 
            the recent cases of the rand manipulation mostly from the ANC party, an economic injection might be a step in the right direction if handled by different stakeholders.<br><br>
            - Service delivery: The coalition may prioritize service delivery, addressing issues like poverty, unemployment, and poor public services. From a personal standpoinnt, I think 
            fully addressing will require more than the commitment to do so. It's easier for people in power to say and tell those in need and affected what they want to hear however when it 
            comes to acting on their words and mainting their consistency, it becomes a different story. There's a large influx of people who are suffering from a lack of service delivery daily
            , trying to fight and ensure that they obtain a better quality of life and standard of living. Fully addressing these issues will require a long term consistent commitment
            to better the lives of those affected.<br><br>
            - Representivity: The inclusion of the DA, a predominantly white party, in the government may help address concerns around racial representation and inclusivity provided the party 
            does not use their political poower and position to subtly recreate racial sterotypes and ideologies.

            Overall, the ANC-DA coalition represents a significant shift in South Africa's political landscape. 
            While it may bring stability and economic growth, it also poses challenges around ideological differences and policy compromises. 
            The success of this coalition will depend on the ability of the ANC and DA to work together effectively and address the country's pressing issues.
