           "One of the ways I feel that the Constitution failed us, is by giving almost absolute protection to Western property 
            rights in section 25 which has made it difficult for land equity in S.A post 1994. It basically made it okay for 
            Apartheid benefactors to keep everything they had and gave them protection. It basically legitimized colonial land theft. 
            It's considered a compromise in that it allowed for redistribution and also recognizes customary property rights but those 
            usually only apply in Bantustans typically" <span class="grey"><cite>(Gebane, 2024)</cite></span>.
