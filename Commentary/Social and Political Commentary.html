              I believe in standing up for what is right. The idea of silence in the midst of a genocide just because one is not directly affected not only conveys a desentitization to the people that are actually
              affected but it also conveys a sense of  being commplicit with the actions of the ones promoting the genocide. This is something the South African country decided not to do. Instead, South Africa's involvement 
              in taking a stand against Israel and standing up for the Palestinian community is truly commendable in several ways.
              Firstly, it demonstrates a commitment to upholding international law and human rights, even in the face of significant political pressure. By supporting the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and 
              condemning Israel's actions as violations of international law, South Africa is setting a powerful precedent for other nations to follow.

            <p1 id="ref">
            Furthermore, South Africa's actions are commendable because they draw on the country's own history of struggle against apartheid and oppression. 
            By recognizing the parallels between their own experiences and those of the Palestinian people, South Africa is demonstrating a sense of solidarity and empathy that is all too rare in international politics.
            Additionally, South Africa's involvement in the ICJ case against Israel sends a strong message that the international community will no longer tolerate Israel's impunity and violations of international law. 
            This is a crucial step towards holding Israel accountable for its actions and ultimately achieving justice and peace for the Palestinian people. While the latter is the ultimate goal , holding Israel accountable
            is not just about getting them to admit their wrongs in the entore genocidal war but it is also about ensuring that such a thing never happens again. Part of doing this involves measures to de-powerise Israel,
            taking away every ounce of ammunity they seem to have over other countries or regions. Even the latter still does not justify the extent of the hurt, damage and brutality shown to the Palestinian people, however,
            it can be a step towards getting the Palestinian community the justice they rightfully deserve.

            In a world where power and political interests often trump principle and morality,<span class="white">South Africa's stance is a beacon of hope and a reminder that nations can and should stand up for what is right</span>, 
            even in the face of adversity. By refusibg to keep quiet because the genocidal war does not affect them directly, the South African country has choses to avoid being complicit
            and express not only their empathy but also the steps they have taken to ensure that the Palestinian Community KNOWS  how in support of them the country is.
            Furthermore, South Africa's involvement in the ICJ case against Israel also highlights the importance of international solidarity and cooperation in the pursuit of justice and human rights. 
            By working together with other nations and international organizations, South Africa is helping to build a global movement that prioritizes the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality,
           <span class="white">expressing the epitome of "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" (A person is a person through others)</span>.Showing Humanity to others is not just about extending kindness to the in times of trouble, 
            it is also about the actions and steps taken to ensure that the next person recognizes your efforts in acknowledging the part of the that makes them human.

            In addition, South Africa's stance is a <span class="white">powerful reminder that the struggle for Palestinian rights is not only a matter of justice and human rights but also a struggle for international law and accountability</span>. 
            By holding Israel accountable for its actions, South Africa is helping to reinforce the principle that all nations, regardless of their power or influence, are subject to the rule of law and must be held accountable for their actions.
            This especially if their actions are detrimental to the lives of those affected and they exhibit the highest form of being inhumane and intentional suffering.
            Overall, South Africa's involvement in the ICJ case against Israel is a commendable example of leadership, solidarity, and commitment to justice and human rights. 
            It serves as a powerful inspiration to other nations and international organizations to take similar action and work towards a more just and equitable world for all.

              The issues outlined in the list above have affected atleast all who reisde in South Africa, even if it is just one. I will briefly explain some of them and the impact thereof on those
              affected based on the research I've gathered. This will hopefully show WHY the people of South Africa were hell bent on voting the ANC out. While the latter did not happen,  please think about what that means for the future of
              South African people and whether you think there's hope for these issues to be resolved...:<br><br>
              <span class="grey">1.Unemployment:</span><br>
              - Meaning: Lack of job opportunities, leading to financial struggles and poverty.
              - Stats: South Africa's current unemployment rate is around 48% and counting (Stats SA, 2024).
             - Impact: Affected people struggle to make ends meet, leading to poverty, homelessness, and social unrest. This is mostly young people wh0 are graduates. The latter is close to home because most of us can relate to the struggles that 
             people we know have faced with their trouble in finding a job.

             <span class="grey">NSFAS Defunding Students:</span><br>
             - Meaning: Reduction or withdrawal of funding for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, affecting tertiary education accessibility.<br>
            - Stats: In 2023, NSFAS faced a R5.2 billion shortfall, impacting thousands of students (TimesLIVE, 2023).<br>
            - Impact: Affected students face financial exclusion, limiting their education and future opportunities.<span class="white"> If you're not radicalized by this, you don't understand the struggle the same</span>.<br>
            This has caused things like University Shutdowns where students have taken to the streets to fight for access to education and not many have been able to receive that right. It's a constant battle,even up untill
            today.

            - Meaning: Artificial influence on the South African rand's value, potentially benefiting select individuals or groups.<br>
            - Stats: The rand's value fluctuates frequently, with some alleging manipulation (Reuters, 2022).<br>
            - Impact: South African people have experienced economic instability, inflation, and reduced purchasing power. Food prizes have been ridiculously expensive and the the cost of living 
            has become to high. While this remains the current fate for some citizens, it is made worse by issues like unemployement.

            - Impact:  South African  people  have  faced inconvenience, economic losses, and potential safety risks. A lot of crimes have occured because of loadshedding, causing people to live 
            in fear. Electricity units have become reduced for high amounts of money spent and businesses in the country have had to resort to invest in getting generators.

            As it stands, the election results have once again favored the ANC, leaving the fate of the future of the aforementioned issues precariously balanced. 
            While the youth and those who didn't vote for the ANC made their voices heard by reducing the party's parliamentary seats, the majority of votes still went to the ANC. 
            This raises crucial questions:
            What does this mean for the resolution of the issues outlined? Are we, as a nation, not angry enough about the persistent problems that plague our country?<br>
            Are we willing to continue living with the status quo, or do we demand real change?<br>
            Does the ANC's continued dominance indicate a lack of faith in alternative parties or a desire for stability, even if it means perpetuating the same issues?<br>
            Are we prioritizing short-term security over long-term progress?<br>
            Can we truly expect the same government that has been at the helm during times of turmoil to suddenly become the driving force for change? Or are we just perpetuating a cycle of disappointment?<br>
            By re-electing the ANC, are we not perpetuating the same systems and structures that have failed us thus far? Are we willing to settle for incremental improvements or do we demand radical transformation?<br>
            If so, what does that say about us , as the affected people who understand the impact of the aforementuioned issues because they affect us directly.?<br>
            The answers to these questions will determine the trajectory of our country's future. Will we continue to tread on thin ice, or will we take bold steps towards meaningful change? Only time will tell.<br><br>
