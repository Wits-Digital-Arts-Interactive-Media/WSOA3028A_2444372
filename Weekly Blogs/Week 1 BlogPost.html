    <h1>Experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages:</h1>
    <section>
        My experience with setting up GitHub was a seamless one in that it was quite easy to understand how to set up stuff like 
        repositories and commits because of having used them last year. Deploying the website onto the pages section of git was
        quite interesting and very fun to learn. I had qustions about it which got answered during our class session and I was very
        content with what i learnt from class. i was excited with making the website even though it wasn't my first time setting up 
        my html doccie as i have some experience with working with html from my previous undergrad. Overall , it was an insightful
        and interesting event working with git and setting up the flow for the entire semester !

    <h1>Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today:</h1>
    <section>
        So i did two of the readings we were provided with. Namely; Berners-Lee et al "The World wide Web" as well as Bush V's "As We May Think".
        With the first one; i found it quite easy to understand especially as far the subject mattter is concerned. It provided a lot of
        context to the understanding of what really makes up the web at large. I learnt a lot about the concepts W3C and W3 Client Programme
        ,the utilization of the HTTP Protocol , the fundamentals of the URLs and URI schemes as well as HTML as a mark up language
        and all that underpins it.
        in terms of relating the reading at large with my experience with the internet today; the reading really provided a lot of 
        exposition to the use of internet as we know it today. It helped me understand not only the meanings of sources i interact
        with on a daily but it also helped situate my headspace into the foundations that formed the internet we have today that i may have been oblivious for some time.

        I found Bush's text very complex at first. I think this was because it was because of the vocabulary and phrasing of most terms
        that he uses to explain a lot of things. After a few re-reads i understood the reading at  large as underpinned by the background
        knowledge of a modern day computer. in the reading , he takes us on a journey of he develped his concept of a modern day computer
        using what he terms as a "MEMEX". He defines it as a digital library device that essentially stores all his books, records and
        communications. The reading also fiils us in on the evolution of machines post the times the reading was written in 1945 and 
        and what the changes that have been made mean for those who engage with the medium of computers today. This made the reading 
        more interesting for me in relation to my experience today because i particularly found the way he explains the evolution and 
        contemporary existence of photography intersting in relation to which the internet started as versus what it is has become.
        From someone who was part of the Manhattan , living in times where they had no internet and how he became the brains behind
        the creation of a modern computer speaks volume about the different ways in which internet was understood back in the day 
        to how it is perceived today. There is a lot of history that underpins the existence of the internet and all the technologies
        that we use to access it that have become close to being erased in contemporary times because we couldn't "care" less about 
        it was brought about. What the reading does is to remind about that history and shift the paradigm on the internet "as we may think"
        about it.

    <h1>Interesting things you have found about the history of the web:</h1>
    <section>
        Based off reading the history of the WWW, I have found quite a few things interesting about the web that i think should be 
        embraced more. This includes the huge contribution of people like Tim Berners-Lee in coming up with the idea of the web back in 
        1989. It is interesting how the creation of the internet as well as the web started of as something at a small scale that utilizes 
        mark up languages like html has made it to become so extensible to the users back then as well users of today who still engage
        with the raw idea that was produced from years ago. The stages of history that the web has undergone encompassing the creation 
        of more technologies such as the URLs is also one of things i found particularly interesting about the web because of how it teaches us 
        of the broader scope that underpins the web apart from its connection to networks of networks and its existence on the internet.

    <h1>Your goals for this course:</h1>
    <section>
        Apart from wanting to improve my knowledge in the space of web dev and passing really well, i also look forward to using the skills gained here as well 
        the portfolio we are going to make and investing it into the creation of more authentic inventions. I hope to hone and channel
        my skill and knowledge into creating intuitive websites and apps, ones that will help alleviate some of the issues we experience
        today.
