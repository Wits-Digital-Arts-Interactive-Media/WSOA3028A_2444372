        <h2>Brief Intro</h2>
        <p3>The Blockman-Parkhurst Restaurant is a that focuses on providing a refreshing dining experience for its customers.
            Situated in the east of Joburg, The Blockman caters specifically for meat lovers with its unique steak experience and <br>
            other tyopes of meat that it offers and prides itself in.
            This analysis wll use the heuristic approach by Miklos Philips whic also focuses particularly on how website designs adhere to 
            Interaction Design Principles.

        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <p4>
            <u>Navigation and Discoverability:</u>
            <ul>
              <li>This website provoides a very interesting and uniwue  navigation experience that I've noted not many websites use. It uses the 
              mouse scroll wheel as its main tool for users to use to move along and traverse their website. Their webpage interface is divided 
              by a split screen where if users scroll down, the two split screens move in  vertically opposite directions. That is, the left side 
              of the screen will go up , while the right side of the screen goes down or vise versa. As such, this minimises less mouse clicks and 
              more mouse wheel scrolling, which ultimately increaeses the overall traversal speed of the website and induces a smooth "flow" experience
              of the website. It is easy for users to find what they are looking for for example things like the menu or their wine lexicon section.
              The icons used in this website are clearly labelled, which decreases the amount of time users take to decipher their meanings.
              See Picture below:</li>

        </p4>
        <p5>
            <u>Signifiers:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>On areas of the website that are clickable, the website uses a metaphorical representation of a human hand that looks like it is 
                    clicking or pointing at something when you hover a clickable area. For example, when users click on the far middle right dots, the mouse
                    cursor changes from the normal arrow to the hand index finger signifier. As such, users can immediately decipher that the area that they are hovering 
                    over is clickable. An example of this on the website , is when users hover over the logo in the top left corner of the webpage  or when
                    users hover over  each of the five dots in the middle right section of the website.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p5>
        <p6>
            <u>Feedback:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The vertial slider arrangement of navigation through splitting information on screen that the website uses prvides users with 
                    immediate feedback of their actions.Players visually see the changing state of the website based on their input. Not only is the 
                    state of the website changing but the visual heiracy of information also changes. Players notice that they are on the next layer or level
                    of the website traversal journey. The use of different contrast and changing color pallete between white and red  also lets players know 
                    that they have also transitioned into another state of the website.
                    <br>
                    When the content of the html content is rendering or still loading while users wait, users are given immediate feedback that infers the idea of a 
                    loading screen through changing  small centred animals on the webpage.See below:

                </li>
            </ul>
        </p6>
        <p7>
            <u>Visual Hierachy and Emphasis:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    According to Miklos Phillips,<blockquote>"Visual Hierarchy concerns the arrangement of elements in a way that implies importance. 
                    It influences the order at which the human eye perceives‚Äù <cite>(Philips, 2016).</cite></blockquote>
                    In the Blockman Restaurant, information on whis website has been laid out in sections that dictates a hierachical structure from most important
                    to the least important. The dots found in the middle right side of the website ensure that users are made aware of what order of importance
                    they are supposed to traverse the website in. An example that shows the disticntion they have made within their website to address each
                    aspect of importance in their website is the way in which the menu  and their meat and wine  lexcion sections are put right at the top before users could get
                    to any other services the restaurant has to offer. not only does this infer a strong sense of importance on the main services they offer that they
                    offer that they want customers to be immediately aware of but it also conveys  a strong  sense of the overall objective of the website emphasized by 
                    its position within the hierachy of information found on this website.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p7>
        <p8>
            <u> Aesthetic & Minimalistic Design:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The use of constraint within the the number option available to users at each point within the traversal of this website infers 
                    a strong sense of constraints applied. Users are only allowed to have access to a few options as possible so that their path in traversing 
                    this website is guided and confusion is minimised. This is also seen through the website minimalistic design of using less button clicks and 
                    more mouse wheel scrolling. Not only does this infer an intuitivbe approach because users cannot see any button or hyperlink to click on
                    but it also reduces cogintive load on users as they do not have to spend quite some tike trying to figuire out where to go to next or which 
                    button to click. The consistency of the website's red and white color pallete design within changing webpages creates familiarity of the eye
                    with the color choice design of the website. Users are not forced to adapt to far fatched or very different colors used on the website , instead
                    what they see at the beginning of the website as far as color palette, similarity and choice is concerned , is exactly what they end up with at the end or 
                    last section of the website. This consistency in turn creates an engaging traversal experience and a smoother "flow" of the website overall.

        <h4>Cons:</h4>
        <p9>
            <u>Semantic Mark-up and Microformatting:</u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Unfortunantely, although most of the things on this webiste look good visually and are appealing to audiences visiting the site, their 
                    semantic mark-up within their html code is not that great. There are a lot of div tags(some are empty) that are used unccessarily that could have been
                    replaced with the correct semantic tags for enhanced semantic meaning. For example; a lot of their image tags(their picture optimatimization) are 
                    used without the figure or figure caption tag to wrap them . They also do not make use of the "alt" attribute to provide a written description of what 
                    the images are showing. In that way, this makes the image inaccesible to people with disabilities such as Blindness.
                    As far as their Microformatting is concerned, as a restaurant that people may not necessarily know about, their html code does not contain 
                    enough structured data for people to find out more about this restauarant and their services apart from them actual visiting the website to 
                    find out more information. This is als another point that decreased the website's ovrall accessibility.
