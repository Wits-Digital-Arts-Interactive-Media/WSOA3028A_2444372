            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <section>
                User alignment as a concept largely encompasses the way the layout, the content, and features of a website meet and are in line with the needs 
                and expectations of the users that will interact and engage with your website.
                With that said, more than anything, I want my website to showcase and offer a lot more than I can do academically.
                I want users <strong>to see beyond my academic capabilities</strong> and <strong> to experience my thoughts especially my commentary on 
                socio-cultural, political, and current affairs</strong> that affect myself as well as the users that would potentially be interacting with the website.
                Exploration of my academic skillsets remains the key however its not the only purpose the existence of my website will serve.

            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <section>
            Future Employers = a fixed portion of my website will serve to be an extension of my academic skillset 
            from which I would hope for employers to derive meaning from.
            <br>
            <strong>
            Young, inquisitive people interested in discourse around socio-cultural</strong> issues that affect our livelihoods 
            especially within a South African context.
            </section>
            <h1>Type of Content</h1>
            <section>
                With this website, I aim to create a balance of showcasing my academic skill set and capabilities with my own reviews and 
                analyses of socio-cultural and political issues affecting SA citizens within a South African context.
                The commentary within this website will also extend to game development and subject matters that encompasses the function that games 
                aim to serve within the demographic that interacts with them.
            </section>
            <h1>User Experience</h1>
            <section>
                To create this balance and hopefully maintain it, this website will be divided into sections that detail and showcase my academic skill set 
                as well as expose users to thoughts around game studies and existing artefacts. These thoughts will also involve my social commentary and 
                thus a distinction in the form of “headers” will become very useful in guiding users exploring the website, knowing  where to go from which point to reach the next point.
                The point of all this is to induce an experience of what an extension of me would feel like  within the constraint of a website. Users engaging with these various aspects 
                of the website will hopefully experience the well rounded balance i speak about and will probably have a tool from which they can examine and critique all information that was presented to them.

            <h1>Interface Elements</h1>
            <section>
                To foster an easy-to-understand directory and a consistent guidance throughout the website at large, the following are elements I aim to use:

                Input Controls = The use of buttons and text fields. These will also be color coded intuitively to propel users to know that they should be clicking 
                a specific button at a specific point in time within the stage or level of the website they would be in.
                Navigation Controls = The use of a search field right at the top of each webpage in the website that will aid the user in finding or looking up something 
                they may think about while on the website or to accelerate the exploring of the website faster.
                Informational Controls= The use of tool tips could aid the users in navigating the website a bit more efficiently.
            </section>
            <h1>Style Process</h1>
            <section>
                As far as this aspect of my website is concerned, I aim to use (when we get to CSS) an <strong>intuitive user approach</strong>.
                By this I mean that when users interact with my website, I aim to lessen information overload by investing good intuitive approaches that include the synchronization of colour and symbols 
                to enhance faster navigation control and more seamless traversal of the main key components of my website. 
                An example of this approach is the colour “green” to indicate to users their next input action within their traversal of the website (e.g. a green button or green hyperlink or arrow). 
                Semiotically, the signifier “green” and basing this specifically within an African context, extends to mean a “thumbs up “or “go ahead” of some sort when it comes to reading it as a sign. 
                By using colours such as green, red and blue, users are able to relate their conventional understanding of colour theory to the use of symbols to intuitively traverse the website smoother 
                with less or organized cognitive overload.
