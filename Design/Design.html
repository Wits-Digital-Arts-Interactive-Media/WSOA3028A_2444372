     <h1>Style Guide Process:</h1>

    <section>
       <h3>My Goal and Aesthetic :</h3>
        <p>With this website, I really want showcase  my ability to use words for meaningfulness and nuance. I chose to go with the  
        <strong>natural</strong> aesthetic tinted with <em> nature </em> addition because the nature mataphor stands to represent the thoughts
        I pour out into this website, apart from the programming ability.
        As such , The following are the color palletes I have decided to go with:
        <picture>
            <figure>
                <a href="../Images/COLOR PALETTE №10.jpeg" alt= "A picture showing RGB values of various shades of green color palletes"  title="Various shades of green color palletes" width="800px" height="700px"></a>
                <figcaption>A picture of varying degrees of green color palletes</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </picture>
        <picture>
            <figure>
                <a href=".../Images/color pallete 2.png" alt ="A Leafy background with hex color palletes designs" title="Leafy background with green to light brown color palletes" width="800px" height="700px"></a>
                <figcaption>A leafy background image of varying shades of green to brown color palletes</figcaption>8
            </figure>
        </picture>
        <h3>Visual Design Decisions:</h3>
        <p1>
            As expressed in my week 4 blog post, 
            An example of this approach is <strong> the colour “green” to indicate to users their next input action</strong> within their traversal of the website (e.g. a green button or green hyperlink or arrow). 
            Semiotically, the signifier “green” and basing this specifically within an African context, extends to mean a “thumbs up “or “go ahead” of some sort when it comes to reading it as a sign. 

            The following are some of the visual designs that showcase the latter statement:
            <figure>
                <video controls width="800px" height="700px">
                  <source src="../Videos/GIFs/Visual Cues design.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <title>A green switch button  showing the difference between a right or wrong action</title>
                <figcaption>Switch gif using the color green to symbolize a correct action</figcaption>
                <cite>Unique footages, (2024)</cite>
              </figure>
             To expand further on the above video, I aim to use the color green to invoke  intuitive responses from my users. This does not mean that this will be the only 
             color defining the scope of actionable events but it will play huge role in aiding users to understanding that they are on track with what they are doing 
             and most importantly, they are are doing the right thing.
