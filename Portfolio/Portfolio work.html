    <h3 class="heading1"><u>Buoyancy  Weight-themed Prototype</u></h3>
    <section>
    <p1 id="ref">
     This prototype was the beginning phase of three iterations where I explore the concepts of Buoyancy within  the context of unity's gravity system. In the game,
     players have to apply buoyancy to make the balls go up. The action of balls going up represents the larger force acting on the weight of the object,
     which then becomes greater than the force of gravity and thus causes the ball to go up.<br><br>

    <h4 class="heading1"><u>Perfect Squares Prototype</u></h4>
    <section>
      <p2 id="ref">
     This prototype is basically a recreation of the game called Threes. In the game , players have to move squares of the same number so that they combine or collide with 
     each other to form a perfect square number. The game ends when the player manages to reach the target  perfect square score before their squares run out.<br><br>

    <section>
      <p3 id="ref">
       This is a puzzle game that tests players ability to use color theory, corodination and movement. In the game , players have to rotate, move and place flowers or rather 
       gears that are visually designed as flowers to make the colors of them match. By doing this , players in turn help sort and arrange the gears or flowers in what would form
       a cordinated flower garden at the end. This was group project  and I helped design the easy amd medium levels.<br><br>
